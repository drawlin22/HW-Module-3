git# JSdrawlin3

## Description

Module 3 was to create a password generator using given starer code. The password generator should ask the user a series of questions such as desired length ranging between 8 and 128 characters, as well as which types of characters (upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, symbols) that they want to be a part of their generated password. The selections are made using window confirm boxes. Once selections are made and the generate password button is clicked a random password is generated using the criteria from user selections. If no selections are made, or an established unacceptable length for password is entered, then the user is alerted about the invalid entry.
